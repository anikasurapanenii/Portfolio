            <h3>Scratch Game</h3>
            <h5>Ball Bounce</h5>
            <img src="Images/scratchgame.png" vspace="10" class="col-md-3 icon sidephoto blur"/>
            <p class="col-md-8">In this project, my partner and I created a ball bouncing game using the program Scratch. As the ball bounces a level up and touches the arrow, the player moves on to the next level. The point of the game is to pass all of the obstacles advancing in levels. The objective of this project was to learn the basic functions of coding by using drag and drop. One lesson learned was how the coding syntax is supposed to be layed out.</p>

             <h3>App Inventor Game</h3>
             <h5>Mole Mash</h5>
            <img src="Images/molemash.jpg" vspace="10" class="col-md-3 icon sidephoto blur"/>
            <p class="col-md-8">In this project, my partners and I created a similar version of the game "Mole Mash" using the program App Inventor. We added new features like faster moving moles as the player progresses through the levels and different colored moles giving out different amounts of points. The intention of this activity was also to learn how to use drag and drop to make a game app. From this project, I learned that it was difficult to make add-ons into the project as the levels progressed.</p>

            <img src="Images/website.png" vspace="10" class="col-md-3 icon sidephoto blur"/>
            <p class="col-md-8">In this project, I made a website which included various pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also had content in each page, accumulative projects, and more. I also added new features aside from the original instructions like a 'bring to the top' button when scrolling 20 px down the page on the Resume and Projects page, embedding a resume and contact me form, and blurring the images when hovering over them on the Home Page. The objective of this was to learn how to code your own website and to use your website throughout your high school career as your Engineering Portfolio. I learned how to use HTML and CSS to code a website. </p>

             <h3>Python Text Adventure</h3>
             <h5>Escape the Cave</h5>
            <img src="Images/website.png" vspace="10" class="col-md-3 icon sidephoto blur"/>
            <p class="col-md-8">In this project, my partner and I created a user interactive game using Python called "Escape the Cave". Our game had multiple stages and ways they could either die or survive advancing on to new levels. We used raw_input, time.sleep, functions, no loops, and more. </p>

             <h5>Hangman Game</h5>

            <p class="col-md-8">In this project, my partner and I created a Hangman game for four lettered words where we had user interaction and they guessed which words would fit. We used ASCII art to form the body and time.sleep. It was multiplayer.</p>

             <h3>Python Image Manipulation</h3>
             <h5>Image Manipulation of Five Various Layouts</h5>
            <img src="Images/website.png" vspace="10" class="col-md-3 icon sidephoto blur"/>
            <p class="col-md-8">In this project, my partner and I created five different layouts for different hobbies placed on different images. Depending on which the user asked for, they would recieve a certain background after uploading a picture. Some themes we had were travelling, arts, technology, photography and gardening. Since we chose the Family theme, the picture came with a border and a couple different icons relating to the theme. </p>
